            Traveller(India) invites you to discover the mesmerising beauty of our Indian subcontinent.
            Combining the cultural splendours of India with the snow covered Himalayan peaks
            of Nepal, the serenity of Bhutan, green tea estates of Sri Lanka and the turquoise
            beaches of Maldives, the Indian sub continent treasures it all.
        </p><p class="text" style="color:black">
            When travelling to India, it is worth taking a short trip to a neighbouring country,
            to enhance your experience. You will notice a striking similarity, yet subtle differences
            in the people, food, culture, religion and lifestyle in the entire Indian subcontinent.
            It is in these differences that we celebrate the ‘unity in diversity’ of our land.
